# 🎲 Pig Game

Pig Game is a fun two-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a great beginner-friendly project to practice DOM manipulation and game logic.

## 🧩 Game Rules

1. The game has two players, taking turns.
2. On a player’s turn, they can **roll the dice**:
   - If the roll is not `1`, the number is added to their **current score**.
   - If the player rolls a `1`, their **current score is lost**, and it’s the next player’s turn.
3. The player can choose to **“Hold”**:
   - Their current score is added to their **total score**, and it becomes the next player's turn.
4. The first player to reach or exceed **100 points** wins the game.
